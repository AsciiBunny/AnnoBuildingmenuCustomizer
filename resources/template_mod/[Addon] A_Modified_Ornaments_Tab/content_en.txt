#A_Modified_Ornaments_Tab_MU

To get the vanilla building menu appearance for the ornaments, the Arctic and Enbesa also got an ornaments menu.
I have added a separate mods and harbour tab.

The existing categories don't really offer much space for mods, and the number of mods is constantly increasing.
I was also missing the possibility of sorting port ornaments in a meaningful way, because not every port is industrial.

This new menu can be used by other modders, and is basically desirable, as long as it fits into these categories and wants to be used.
